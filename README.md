# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Repository

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files and data files for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on various datasets. EDA is an essential step in the data analysis process that helps us understand and gain insights into the data.

## Contents

- [EDA_on_Google_play_store.ipynb](EDA_on_Google_play_store.ipynb): This notebook contains EDA on the Google Play Store dataset.
- [EDA_on_Netflix.ipynb](EDA_on_Netflix.ipynb): This notebook contains EDA on the Netflix Titles dataset.
- [EDA_on_Student_Performance.ipynb](EDA_on_Student_Performance.ipynb): This notebook contains EDA on the Student Performance dataset.
- [EDA_on_flight_price.ipynb](EDA_on_flight_price.ipynb): This notebook contains EDA on the Flight Price dataset.
- [EDA_with_red_wine_data.ipynb](EDA_with_red_wine_data.ipynb): This notebook contains EDA on the Red Wine Quality dataset.

## Data Files

The following data files are used in the EDA notebooks:

- [flight_price.csv](flight_price.csv): Data related to flight prices.
